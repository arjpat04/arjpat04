# `whoami` üßë‚Äçüíª
I‚Äôm an undergraduate developer who loves turning ideas into working projects, whether that‚Äôs a small web app for class, a game prototype with friends, or a tool to make everyday tasks easier! Most of my experience comes from university coursework, hackathons, and personal experiments.

I enjoy figuring out how different technologies fit together, from setting up basic cloud deployments to managing code in version control and building automation pipelines. Outside of classwork, I‚Äôm always tinkering with new frameworks, exploring the latest dev tools, and experimenting with how to make software more intuitive and fun to use!

Some of my personal projects have included:

- Personal Finance Tracker
  - REST API in .NET Core with secure authentication.
  - Containerized using Docker and deployed to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
  - Helm charts used for deployment configuration.
- Online Quiz Platform
  - Backend in ASP.NET Web API serving quiz questions from a database.
  - Front-end in a simple JavaScript or Blazor WebAssembly app.
  - Azure Functions for scoring logic and leaderboard updates.
- Student Study Group Finder
  - Uses .NET API for matching students based on classes and availability.
  - Data stored in Azure Cosmos DB.
  - Kubernetes-deployed microservices for user management, chat, and scheduling.
